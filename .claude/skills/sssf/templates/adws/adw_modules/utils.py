    which prepends its ephemeral venv's bin to PATH and sets VIRTUAL_ENV. That
    venv holds the ADW's OWN dependencies (pydantic, pyyaml), not the
    operator's, so anything a subprocess resolves through it — `python3`,
    `pip`, every globally pip-installed CLI — silently becomes the wrong one.

    Stripping the venv restores parity: `python3` in an agent's bash is the
    same `python3` the engineer gets in their terminal. The ADW's own imports
    are unaffected; this env is only ever handed to child processes.
